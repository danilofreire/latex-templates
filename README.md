# LaTeX Templates

LaTeX templates I like. This repository is for personal use only, but feel free to fork or download it. The templates use [Linux Libertine](http://www.linuxlibertine.org/) and [Fira](http://mozilla.github.io/Fira/) fonts, British English spelling, dark blue and mahogany colour for links, double spacing, back references, and numbered sections. The article and cover letter templates are my own; the beamer template is the cool [mtheme](https://github.com/matze/mtheme) by [Matthias Vogelgesang](https://bloerg.net/); the [a0poster class](https://www.latextemplates.com/template/a0poster-portrait-poster) was created by [Gerlinde Kettl and Matthias Weiser](mailto:tex@kettl.de); and [Jason Blevins](http://jblevins.org/projects/cv-template/) is the author of the CV template. Thanks to all of them for their great work! I don't know who created the original thesis template, so cheers to the anonymous contributor too :) 

I have modified all third-party templates, sometimes substantially. I hope you enjoy the output.
